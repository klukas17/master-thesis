	abstract="Given their economic importance, there is continuing research interest in providing better and better solutions to real-world scheduling problems. The models for such problems are increasingly complex and exhaustive search for optimal solutions is usually impractical. Moreover, difficulty in accurately modelling the problems means that mathematically ``optimal'' solutions may not actually be the best possible solutions in practice. Therefore heuristic methods are often used, which do not guarantee optimal or even near optimal solutions. The main goal of heuristics is to produce solutions of acceptable quality in reasonable time. The problem owners often prefer simple, easy to implement heuristic approaches which do not require significant amount of resources for their development and implementation [12]. However, such individual heuristics do not always perform well for the variety of problem instances which may be encountered in practice. There is a wide range of modern heuristics known from the literature which are specifically designed and tuned to solve certain classes of optimisation problems. These methods are based on the partial search of the solution space and often referred as metaheuristics.",

abstract="The key idea underlying iterated local search is to focus the search not on the full space of all candidate solutions but on the solutions that are returned by some underlying algorithm, typically a local search heuristic. The resulting search behavior can be characterized as iteratively building a chain of solutions of this embedded algorithm. The result is also a conceptually simple metaheuristic that nevertheless has led to state-of-the-art algorithms for many computationally hard problems. In fact, very good performance is often already obtained by rather straightforward implementations of the metaheuristic. In addition, the modular architecture of iterated local search makes it very suitable for an algorithm engineering approach where, progressively, the algorithms' performance can be further optimized. Our purpose here is to give an accessible description of the underlying principles of iterated local search and a discussion of the main aspects that need to be taken into account for a successful application of it. In addition, we review the most important applications of this method and discuss its relationship to other metaheuristics.",
